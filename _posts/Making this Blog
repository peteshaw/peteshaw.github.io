## How I put all this together.

I was looking for a platform to host my new blog on, and I was feeling that blogspot just wasn't going to cut it.  In my searching the web, I came across Jekyll.  Not only did it use some reasonably modern tech, a.k.a. Ruby, Markdown, Liquid templates, but it was possible to host your site for free.  

I am a big fan of cheap.  Free is good.  Wonderful.  I started with the main site, [Jekyll ](jekyllrb.com).  From there I discovered [Jekyll Now](github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), which is stupidly simple to set up. 

Then I started playing around with themes.  That is where I am now, as of October 7, 2019.
